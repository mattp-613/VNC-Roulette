# VNC-Roulette
This script is taken from https://github.com/davidomil/VNCMassscan and the API from the used tools are inserted locally.

vncdotool and https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan are required for this. pip install vncdotool or use the dependencies given in this project to do it, shouldn't need to install vncdotools but best to do it anyways
