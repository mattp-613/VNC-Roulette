# VNC-Roulette
This script is taken from https://github.com/davidomil/VNCMassscan and the API from the used tools are inserted locally.

vncdotool and https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan are required for this. pip install vncdotool or use the dependencies given in this project to do it, shouldn't need to install vncdotools but best to do it anyways. twisted is also recommended to install either through pip or the github
please install these pips as the superuser
you'd also want to run this in a venv. so through venv/bin/, run python to run the scripts using sudo ./venv/bin/python VNCScreenshotgrabber.py and similiarily to install dependencies on pip
Generally the first text of the ips.txt hsa to be deleted. It's a workaround to how masscan works
